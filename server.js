The idea was to create a comfortable and friendly fish shack like the many that are scattered along the New England Coast.Our vision was a neighborhood restaurant with an outstanding seafood selection served by a friendly staff. We knew we had to serve the freshest fish, lobstah, and Ipswich clams. And that’s when the journey began for us, and the 24 employees who had the courage to join us.Fast forward to today with a location in South Riding, events by Ford’s Wicked Catering and our newest location in Lansdowne, we still have the same goal. We are on the phone every day with the fisherman tracking down the freshest seafood for our guests. Whether its clams from Massachusetts, Halibut from Alaska, Grouper from Florida, or shrimp from North Carolina, we only accept the freshest of the fresh. This is sometimes a difficult task as weather and seasonal fishing closures can make it virtually impossible to get some of our specialties. We promise to always use sustainable practices to bring you the freshest seafood.We’re honored to have been recognized by The Washington Post, Zagat and Northern Virginia Magazine as one of the best restaurants in the DC-metro area.  Most recently, we were named Best Seafood in Northern Virginia Magazine’s Best of NoVA 2017 feature (for the fifth year in a row!) We have been a returning competitor at Tasting Table’s Lobster Roll Rumble in NYC, featuring 25 of the nation’s Best Lobster Rolls.We would not have been able to make it without our great staff.
